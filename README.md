# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This password generator was given as an initial javascript starter code for practice on writing functions and window alerts. This project also serves as good practice for navigating through the document object model flow, applying mathematics logics in method coding, and learning to look up available methods to use in javascript. This was a complex logic puzzle that required multiple levels of pseudocode and logic that required a lot of navigation to solve.

## Usage

Clicking the "Generate Password" button will prompt the user to confirm how long they want their password to be, between 8 and 128 characters. Entering a non-number or a number outside of this range will cause a window alert to re-prompt the user to type an integer between 8 and 128.

Once a number has been entered, the window alert boxes will prompt the user to select whether they want to include numbers, lowercase letter, uppercase letters, or symbols in the password. Failing to select any of the boxes will cause the window alert to prompt the user to please select at least one type of character.

The generated password should appear in the box in the center of the screen.
